# Suggested structure
## 1st paragraph: 
The career ladder of a software developer consists of three levels: junior, middle, and senior. In order to determine salary level and responsibilites, the industry will refer
to this terminology to understand and assign different degrees of qualification. Software developers are assigned to a degree of qualification based off their level of expertise in terms of: technical knowledge, day-to-day duties, independent work, and contributions to various software development projects. Being able to make this distinction between developers improves efficiency for interaction and interal communication. This means that companies search for developers with senior levels because it helps set more accurate expecations for a particular engineer. The easiest way to indentify a senior level developer is by finding how many signifacnt contributions they have made to a particular software project. However, new comers in software development have difficulty contributing to projects due to their lack of experience.

## 2nd paragraph: 
Junior level developers gain knowledge being involved with projects, however they lack in making significant contributions. Previous work like the 'Theory of software developer expertise' has shown that concepts of "expert" and "expertise" within the field of software development and discovers additional findings on why senior-level developers may contribute more on GitHub compared to first-time developers. This is because more experience and knowledge for software developers are considered more in pull requests on GitHub. The tech industry is starting to have a shortage of software developers. This is because employers are faced by many challenges like software developers having a lack of experience, lack of technical skills, and lack of soft skills. Many software developers are still new to the tech industry and companies expect consistent high-quality history of software development skills. New software developers without the reputation and portfolio have to prove their place to get a job in this industry. Even if new software developers are inexperienced, it may be a good place where even for a small project on GitHub can serve them to be reliable. If we are able to solve this problem, new software developers will be able to get the experience they need, companies will no longer struggle with the massive shortage of programmers and software engineers, and there won't be a gap between first-time developers and senior-level developers on GitHub. From this study of the problem, first-time developers and the tech industry will benefit from it. 

## 3rd paragraph: 
State the purpose of your research. Explain why achieving this purpose will 
solve (or help to solve) the problem. If you have hypotheses, they can appear here.

## After that, 
* RQ 1: How many pull requests have been created on a particular Github project?
  * This will give us an idea of how many contributions are being made by various users on Github. From here, we will choose a few users at random to look further into their github history.
* RQ 2: Refering to specific users, how many pull requests of theirs have been accepted?
  * This will give us data on how many pull requests a specific user has made on a project and how many of those have been accepted. This then tells us how many contributions were actually deemed significant to a project and we will compare the number of significant contributions between various users.

## Then, 

Our goal is to provide a better understanding of how the overall amount of time a developer has been contributing to open-source software relates to the number of contributions made by that developer, as well as how many of those contributions are considered to be “useful” enough to be accepted. This study will look at a number of pull requests made on open-source projects on GitHub. For each request, the experience of the user behind it (measured as the amount of time elapsed since the first GitHub contribution made by the user), the number of contributions made by that user, and whether the pull was merged will all be considered.

implications will appear after you have the results).
