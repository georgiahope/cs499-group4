# Suggested structure
## 1st paragraph: 
Start with an impactful positive sentence making clear the research topic and 
its relevance (it is always good to start a paper with a strong sentence – but it cannot be 
something that you can’t show scientific evidence for it). In the rest of the paragraph, justify 
your topic, describing its relevance and context. Characterize the context from which the 
research problem will emerge (you will probably say something very positive and then say 
“however, ….”). If needed, you can use an extra paragraph to describe the topic/context. See 
the examples provided in PA 3.3.

## 2nd paragraph: 
New comers in software development have difficulty contributing to projects due to their lack of experience. Although they gain knowledge being involved with projects, they lack in making significant contributions. Previous work like the 'Theory of software developer expertise' has shown that concepts of "expert" and "expertise" within the field of software development and discovers additional findings on why senior-level developers may contribute more on GitHub compared to first-time developers. This is because more experience and knowledge for software developers are considered more in pull requests on GitHub. The tech industry is starting to have a shortage of software developers. This is because employers are faced by many challenges like software developers having a lack of experience, lack of technical skills, and lack of soft skills. Many software developers are still new to the tech industry and companies expect consistent high-quality history of software development skills. New software developers without the reputation and portfolio have to prove their place to get a job in this industry. Even if new software developers are inexperienced, it may be a good place where even for a small project can serve them to be reliable. If we are able to solve this problem, new software developers will be able to get the experience they need, companies will no longer struggle with the massive shortage of programmers and software engineers, and there won't be a gap between first-time developers and senior-level developers on GitHub. From this study of the problem, first-time developers and the tech industry will benefit from it. 

## 3rd paragraph: 
State the purpose of your research. Explain why achieving this purpose will 
solve (or help to solve) the problem. If you have hypotheses, they can appear here.

## After that, 
State your research question(s), with the motivation for each of them. Remember: 
the answers to the RQs must be connected to the purpose and problem (they should help 
accomplish the purpose and solve the problem). 

## Then, 

Our goal is to provide a better understanding of how the overall amount of time a developer has been contributing to open-source software relates to the number of contributions made by that developer, as well as how many of those contributions are considered to be “useful” enough to be accepted. This study will look at a number of pull requests made on open-source projects on GitHub. For each request, the experience of the user behind it (measured as the amount of time elapsed since the first GitHub contribution made by the user), the number of contributions made by that user, and whether the pull was merged will all be considered. 

## Conclude 
The text describing your contributions and possible implications (the real 
implications will appear after you have the results).
Don’t worry about citations for now. You are going to update the introduction in the next 
deliverable.
