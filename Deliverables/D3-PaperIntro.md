# Suggested structure
## 1st paragraph: 
Start with an impactful positive sentence making clear the research topic and 
its relevance (it is always good to start a paper with a strong sentence – but it cannot be 
something that you can’t show scientific evidence for it). In the rest of the paragraph, justify 
your topic, describing its relevance and context. Characterize the context from which the 
research problem will emerge (you will probably say something very positive and then say 
“however, ….”). If needed, you can use an extra paragraph to describe the topic/context. See 
the examples provided in PA 3.3.

## 2nd paragraph: 
State the research problem. Provide evidence about it (as found in the past 
research or in practice). Make clear the deficiencies in existing knowledge about the problem. 
Describe the consequences/effects of the research problem. Also discuss about the relevance of 
the problem: what will change if you solve the problem? What audiences will benefit from a 
study of the problem? Again, if needed, you can use an extra paragraph to elaborate on the 
research problem. Remember: The problem statement should read like a “pain” that a 
stakeholder has. See the class slides and Creswell’s book for additional explanation. Don’t forget 
to clearly state what the problem is and why the problem is a problem (consequences of the 
problem).

## 3rd paragraph: 
State the purpose of your research. Explain why achieving this purpose will 
solve (or help to solve) the problem. If you have hypotheses, they can appear here.

## After that, 
state your research question(s), with the motivation for each of them. Remember: 
the answers to the RQs must be connected to the purpose and problem (they should help 
accomplish the purpose and solve the problem). 

## Then, 
Our goal is to provide a better understanding of how the overall amount of time a developer has been contributing to open-source software relates to the number of contributions made by that developer, as well as how many of those contributions are considered to be “useful” enough to be accepted. This study will look at a number of pull requests made on open-source projects on GitHub. For each request, the experience of the user behind it (measured as the amount of time elapsed since the first GitHub contribution made by the user), the number of contributions made by that user, and whether the pull was merged will all be considered. 

## Conclude 
the text describing your contributions and possible implications (the real 
implications will appear after you have the results).
Don’t worry about citations for now. You are going to update the introduction in the next 
deliverable.
