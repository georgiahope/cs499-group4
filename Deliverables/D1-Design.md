## Research Topic
First-time developers vs. senior-level developers

## Research Problem
New comers in software development have difficulty contributing to projects due to their lack of experience. Although they gain knowledge being involved with projects, they lack in making significant contributions. 

## Evidence of Research Problem
Previous work like the 'Theory of software developer expertise' has shown that concepts of "expert" and "expertise" within the field of software development and discovers additional findings on why senior-level developers may contribute more on GitHub compared to first-time developers. This is because more experience and knowledge for software developers are considered more in pull requests on GitHub. 

## Purpose Statement
  In this research project, we perform an empirical study over software developer contributions on Github.
## Research Questions
  1. How long has a software developer been contributing to projects on Github?
  2. How many pull requests or contributions have been accepted for a particular project on Github?
  3. Comparing the two different-leveled developers, how many contributions are accepted by a project?
## Objectives
Our goal is to provide a better understanding of how the overall amount of time a developer has been contributing to open-source software 
relates to the number of contributions made by that developer, as well as how many of those contributions are considered to be “useful” enough to be accepted.
	
## Scope
This study will look at a number of pull requests made on open-source projects on GitHub. For each request, the experience of the user behind it 
(measured as the amount of time elapsed since the first GitHub contribution made by the user), the number of contributions made by that user, 
and whether the pull was merged will all be considered.
