## Research Topic
- First-time developers vs. senior-level developers

## Research Problem
New comers in software development have difficulty finding experience because of the
fact they are new and lack experience. This not only makes it hard for projects to find a variety of developers
but it also adds the problem of that low level developers have a hard time progressing if they 
are not gaining experience in projects. Although first-time developers are able to gain knowledge by participating in small parts of projects, they aren't getting that experience due to not being a part of a big contribution to projects like advanced developers.  

## Evidence of Research Problem
Previous work like the 'Theory of software developer expertise' has shown that concepts of "expert" and "expertise" within the field of software development and discovers additional findings on why senior-level developers may contribute more on GitHub compared to first-time developers. This is because more experience and knowledge for software developers are considered more in pull requests on GitHub. 

## Purpose Statement

  In this research project, we perform an empirical study over github user contributions on a specific, software development product.
## Research Questions
  * 1: How long has GitHub users been contributing to projects on Github?
  * 2: How many pull requests or contributions have been accepted for a particular project?
  * 3: How do the two users differ from one another?
    * Does their overall experience time show if they approach with better agile methods or not?
## Objectives
Our goal is to provide a better understanding of how the overall amount of time a developer has been contributing to open-source software 
relates to the number of contributions made by that developer, as well as how many of those contributions are considered to be “useful” enough to be accepted.
	
## Scope
This study will look at a number of pull requests made on open-source projects on GitHub. For each request, the experience of the user behind it 
(measured as the amount of time elapsed since the first GitHub contribution made by the user), the number of contributions made by that user, 
and whether the pull was merged will all be considered.
