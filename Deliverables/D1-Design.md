# D.1 Design

## Research Topic
- First-time developers vs. senior-level developers
- Efficiency & productivity of developers on GitHub 

## Research Problem
First-time developers are often faced with complications of opportunities from the software community. It can often be
difficult for first-time developers to get the experience and resources they need in our field, compared to senior-level 
developers.

## Evidence of Research Problem
Previous work like the 'Theory of software developer expertise' has shown that concepts of "expert" and "expertise" within the field of software development and discovers additional findings on why senior-level developers may contribute more on GitHub compared to first-time developers. This is because more experience and knowledge for software developers are considered more in pull requests on GitHub.
