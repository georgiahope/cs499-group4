## Research Topic
- First-time developers vs. senior-level developers
- Efficiency & productivity of developers on GitHub 

## Research Problem
First-time developers are often faced with complications of opportunities from the software community. It can often be
difficult for first-time developers to get the experience and resources they need in our field, compared to senior-level 
developers.

## Evidence of Research Problem
Previous work like the 'Theory of software developer expertise' has shown that concepts of "expert" and "expertise" within the field of software development and discovers additional findings on why senior-level developers may contribute more on GitHub compared to first-time developers. This is because more experience and knowledge for software developers are considered more in pull requests on GitHub. 

## Purpose Statement

  In this research project, we perform an empirical study over github user contributions on a specific, software development product.
## Research Questions
  * 1: How long has this user been contributing to projects in Github?
  * 2: How many pull requests or contributions have been accepted for a particular project?
  * 3: How do the two users differ from one another?
    * Does their overall experience time show if they approach with better agile methods or not?
## Objectives
Our goal is to provide a better understanding of how the overall amount of time a developer has been contributing to open-source software 
relates to the number of contributions made by that developer, as well as how many of those contributions are considered to be “useful” enough to be accepted.
	
## Scope
This study will look at a number of pull requests made on open-source projects on GitHub. For each request, the experience of the user behind it 
(measured as the amount of time elapsed since the first GitHub contribution made by the user), the number of contributions made by that user, 
and whether the pull was merged will all be considered.
