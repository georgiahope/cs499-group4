# D6. Peer Review
## Summary
give a neutral description of what you think the paper is about, why the problem is important, and what the authors have done

The paper *"Analyzing Pull Requests to Identify Spam Bots"* focuses on the problem that Github has an increasing number of spam bots which disrupt general workflow of projects and results in poor code quality. The authors have identified that bots create pull requests, issues, and other messages on public repositories which contribute largely to the workflow disruption. Three main research questions were created in order to distinguish the difference between spam bots and legitimate user accounts. They begin to study these bots and answer their research questions by developing a program that is meant to not only automatically detect them, but also tries to indentify the distinct features of these bots to ultimately show the difference between a bot and a registered, real user account. With the use of their neural network utilizing machine learning to predict the nature of an account, they found that 16.7% of accounts were spam bots while 6.8% of pull requests were created by those bots. Through the author's qualitative analysis they indentified the distinct features of a spam bot that are: login IDs, bio data, and email-addresses.
