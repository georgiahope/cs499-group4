# D4.1 Systematic Literature Review Protocol and Pilot Study
## 1. Research questions
### 1. Main study research questions
#### [RQ1] How many pull requests have been created on a particular project on Github?
#### [RQ2] Refering to specific users, how many pull requests of theirs have been accepted?
### 2. SLR questions
The overall aim of the SLR is to determine: 
<br /><br />“What is the difference between senior-level and junior-level software developers in terms of how many contributions are accepted to projects?”
<br />“How do the acceptance rate of contributions on software development projects differ with different leveled developers?”
<br />“How do different level software developers contribute to software development projects?”
<br /><br />In order to achieve this objective, and to ensure the collection of all relevant data, several research
questions have been created. These questions will help to ensure that the study will be comprehensive in its nature, whilst providing an in-depth analysis into the past use of robots to teach novices programming. The research questions are:
#### [SLRRQ1] What is the difficulty of the projects being studied to extract data from?
#### [SLRRQ2] What are the characteristics (i.e. how long have they been contributing to Github overall, level of expertise etc.) of the users that contribute to these projects?
#### [SLRRQ3] What is the difference of acceptance rates for contributors on projects on Github?
#### [SLRRQ4] What types of studies are being performed by researchers that investigate the expertise of different leveled software developers?
#### [SLRRQ5] What types of studies are being performed by researchers that investigate the acceptance rates of pull requests on Github?
#### [SLRRQ6] What is the scale of studies (e.g. number of github users/software developers, number of projects, number of pull requests per project etc.) that are being performed by researchers?
#### [SLRRQ7] Do collected studies suggest that senior-level developer's contributions are accepted more frequently than junior-level developers for software development projects?
## 2. Search strategy
1. Resources to be searched
  - Where you are going to search for primary studies? Google Scholar and Github.?????
2. Main concepts and synonyms
  - Create a table with the concepts that you want to search for and the synonyms you are going to use (see e.g. Table 2 from 
  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10606-012-9164-4 ).
3. Query string
  - Present the query string you are going to use on the resources to be searched.
4. Golden set for the validation of the search string
  - Present the set of papers that you want to make sure that the search will return. Execute the query and inform which papers were returned by the 
  query.
## 3. Selection criteria
This selection describes the inclusion and exclusion criteria that will be used to ensure that only relevant literature is accepted into the SLR.
1. Inclusion criteria
  - Publications that include the use of GitHub and the characteristics of the users that contribute to these projects
  - Papers that involve a study on the acceptance of contributions based on software 'experience'
  - Publications with full text available
  - Papers that study the difference of acceptance rates for contributors on project in GitHub
2. Exclusion criteria
  - If the paper isn't focused on GitHub pull requests based on certain characteristics
  - Papers that doesn't propose or describe why pull requests aren't accepted
  - Papers/reports that don't have full text available
  - Papers that don't have software developers as a main focus
3. Selection process
The selection process will be performed by our team with a testing approach being applied after an interval to verify the selection process. The selection process is effectively divided into five phases: 
  i) Select the open source project on GitHub
  ii) Collect the factors that we need(i.e. if it includes many pull requests data, junior vs. senior-level developers, etc.)
  iii) Pre-process the data
  iv) Export and analyze data
  v) Discover relationships between acceptance rates and expertise of software developer
## 4. Data extraction
This section describes how the information that is required from each publication will be obtained. 
1. Data to be collected
All data will be extracted by our team. The results will then be compared and contrasted with one another. The following information will be extracted from accepted studies: 
  - Why the study was accepted into the SLR
  - How the data was collected and analysed during the study
  - Findings and conclusions
  - Effectiveness of 'experience' in GitHub projects 
  - The scale of studies (e.g. number of GitHub users/software developers, number of projects, number of pull requests, etc.) that are being performed
  - Number of contributors on a project
2. Data synthesis
  - Until the results of the SLR are finalized with our data synthesus strategy, it will not be final yet. However, the data we will get from the many research     questions will have tables. We will also summarize what we have found within our studies. The data that we extract during our trial run will be extracted in     our to test the data synthesis process. 
## 5. Pilot study
Follow your protocol until including n primary studies, where n is twice the number of members of the group (if there aren’t that many papers to 
be included, state that explicitly). 
1. Papers selected
  - Report a table with the results of your query in the order they appeared. In one column you put the reference of the paper and in the other, the 
  status (included or excluded). If the paper was excluded, point out the criterion that you used to excluded it from the review).
2. Data collection
  - For each paper, collect information based on the structure defined in Section 4.1.
3. Data synthesis
  - Follow the strategy defined in Section 4.2 to synthesize the information collected.
