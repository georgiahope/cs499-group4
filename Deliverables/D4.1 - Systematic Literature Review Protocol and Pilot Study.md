# D4.1 Systematic Literature Review Protocol and Pilot Study
## 1. Research questions
1. Main study research questions
  - Inform the research questions that you proposed for your main study (you can get them from your paper introduction).
2. SLR research questions
  - Conceive specific research questions that will be answered by your SLR (sometimes they are the same as the main study or they can be more 
  focused on identifying related work, pieces of evidence about the research problem, etc.).
## 2. Search strategy
1. Resources to be searched
  - Where you are going to search for primary studies?
2. Main concepts and synonyms
  - Create a table with the concepts that you want to search for and the synonyms you are going to use (see e.g. Table 2 from 
  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10606-012-9164-4 ).
3. Query string
  - Present the query string you are going to use on the resources to be searched.
4. Golden set for the validation of the search string
  - Present the set of papers that you want to make sure that the search will return. Execute the query and inform which papers were returned by the 
  query.
## 3. Selection criteria
1. Inclusion criteria
  - Present the criteria that you are going to use to include papers.
2. Exclusion criteria
  - Present the criteria that you are going to use to exclude papers.
3. Selection process
  - Present the steps that you will follow to select the papers.
## 4. Data extraction
1. Data to be collected
  - Present the information that will be extracted from each selected paper.
2. Data synthesis
  - Present how the information will be analyzed and combined.
## 5. Pilot study
Follow your protocol until including n primary studies, where n is twice the number of members of the group (if there arenâ€™t that many papers to 
be included, state that explicitly). 
1. Papers selected
  - Report a table with the results of your query in the order they appeared. In one column you put the reference of the paper and in the other, the 
  status (included or excluded). If the paper was excluded, point out the criterion that you used to excluded it from the review).
2. Data collection
  - For each paper, collect information based on the structure defined in Section 4.1.
3. Data synthesis
  - Follow the strategy defined in Section 4.2 to synthesize the information collected.
