# D4.1 Systematic Literature Review Protocol and Pilot Study
## 1. Research questions
### 1. Main study research questions
  - RQ 1: How many pull requests have been created on a particular project on Github?
  - RQ 2: Refering to specific users, how many pull requests of theirs have been accepted?
### 2. SLR questions
The overall aim of the SLR is to determine: 
<br /><br />“What is the difference between senior-level and junior-level software developers in terms of how many contributions are accepted to projects?”
<br />“How do the acceptance rate of contributions on software development projects differ with different leveled developers?”
<br />“How do different level software developers contribute to software development projects?”
<br /><br />In order to achieve this objective, and to ensure the collection of all relevant data, several research
questions have been created. These questions will help to ensure that the study will be comprehensive in its nature, whilst providing an in-depth analysis into the past use of robots to teach novices programming. The research questions are:
#### [SLRRQ1] What is the difficulty of the projects being studied to extract data from?
#### [SLRRQ2] What are the characteristics (i.e. how long have they been contributing to Github overall, level of expertise etc.) of the users that contribute to these projects?
#### [SLRRQ3] What is the difference of acceptance rates for contributors on projects on Github?
#### [SLRRQ4] What types of studies are being performed by researchers that investigate the expertise of different leveled software developers?
#### [SLRRQ5] What types of studies are being performed by researchers that investigate the acceptance rates of pull requests on Github?
#### [SLRRQ6] What is the scale of studies (e.g. number of github users/software developers, number of projects, number of pull requests per project etc.) that are being performed by researchers?
#### [SLRRQ7] Do collected studies suggest that senior-level developer's contributions are accepted more frequently than junior-level developers for software development projects?
## 2. Search strategy
1. Resources to be searched
  - Where you are going to search for primary studies? Google Scholar and Github.?????
2. Main concepts and synonyms
  - Create a table with the concepts that you want to search for and the synonyms you are going to use (see e.g. Table 2 from 
  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10606-012-9164-4 ).
3. Query string
  - Present the query string you are going to use on the resources to be searched.
4. Golden set for the validation of the search string
  - Present the set of papers that you want to make sure that the search will return. Execute the query and inform which papers were returned by the 
  query.
## 3. Selection criteria
1. Inclusion criteria
  - Present the criteria that you are going to use to include papers.
2. Exclusion criteria
  - Present the criteria that you are going to use to exclude papers.
3. Selection process
  - Present the steps that you will follow to select the papers.
## 4. Data extraction
1. Data to be collected
  - Present the information that will be extracted from each selected paper.
2. Data synthesis
  - Present how the information will be analyzed and combined.
## 5. Pilot study
Follow your protocol until including n primary studies, where n is twice the number of members of the group (if there aren’t that many papers to 
be included, state that explicitly). 
1. Papers selected
  - Report a table with the results of your query in the order they appeared. In one column you put the reference of the paper and in the other, the 
  status (included or excluded). If the paper was excluded, point out the criterion that you used to excluded it from the review).
2. Data collection
  - For each paper, collect information based on the structure defined in Section 4.1.
3. Data synthesis
  - Follow the strategy defined in Section 4.2 to synthesize the information collected.
