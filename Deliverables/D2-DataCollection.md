# D2. Data Collection

## 1. Research Question(s)
  * RQ1: How many pull requests have a specific number of users made on Github?
  * RQ2: Of those pull requests, how many have been accepted?

## 2. Data Set
For RQ1 we created a script in Python that displays the total number of pull requests for 5 users on Github using the project facebook/react. Using this data, we can see how many contributions were made by various users. For RQ2 we take those pull requests and see how many of them are accepted. This then gives us an idea of how many of those contributions were significant to a project.
