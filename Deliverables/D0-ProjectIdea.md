# Research Project Idea

## Research Project Idea Statement
We, group 4, would like to research how fast or effeciently junior-level developers become effective and/or productive on projects. More specifically, how fast does it take for first-time developers to program and develop in an agile way similar to senior-level developers? This research question relates to process as well as technical research.
