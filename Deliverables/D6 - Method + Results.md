# Research method: 
You should explain the data collection and data analyzes 
procedures. 
## Data collection: 
Which projects did you select? What was the criteria for 
selecting projects? How did you collect them? What are the 
characteristics/distribution of your data set (demographic information about 
the projects)? Which kind of data have you collected? How have you 
inspected/cleaned/filtered the data to avoid incorrect assumptions? What kind 
of additional data wrangling have you done do to answer the research questions? 
Tables and figures are welcome in this section.
## Data analysis: 
After collecting all the data relevant to the research topic, the data can be viewed in a .csv file. In this .csv file, different columns represent different attributes that have been deemed significant in order to adequately answer the research questions. The data is analyzed through R Studio and is represented by different types of graphs. Scatterplots and bar graphs are used in order to identify a pattern between how old user accounts are versus how many of the user's contributions are merged for a project. In addition, a boxplot using the same data are used to identify potential outliers that exist.
# Results: 
You can organize this section by research question. Show graphs, tables, 
numbers, etc. to help answer the questions. Explain and discuss the results (it is not 
enough to just show the results without explaining them).
